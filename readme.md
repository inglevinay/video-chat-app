If already have account then sign in
else register/sign up through red register link
then you will enter room where you can click button to start meet
you can add members by sharing link(on left of text/chat box) 
people with that link will be able to join
(in alert prompt enter your name for meeting so that you can be noticed in chats).
To go back to main menu simply click heading (Kilvish Chat) it will redirect you to home page.
--------------------
>> NOTE: 1. Video and Chat some times takes time to appear 
            due to network or server issues.
         2. Normal registration is working but there is problem with signup/signin with Google
            our site is https and we can use http but https requires certificate from Google
            so there is error from Google side.
