frontend using bootstrap, css

backend using nodejs

authentication using passport, google oauth node modules

database using mongodb

login using google not working on https connections , need to be troubleshooted.

Directions to use:
-------------------
If already have account then sign in
else register/sign up through red register link
then you will enter room where you can click button to start meet
you can add members by sharing link(on left of text/chat box) 
people with that link will be able to join
(enter your name for meeting so that you can be noticed in chats).
--------------------
>> NOTE: 1. Video and Chat some times takes time to appear 
            due to network or server issues.
         2. Normal registration is working but there is problem with signup/signin with Google
            our site is https and we can use http but https requires certificate from Google
            so there is error from Google side.
